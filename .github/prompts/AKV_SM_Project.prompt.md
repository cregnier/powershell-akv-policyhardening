1) We are using a guest MSA account in a MSDN dev/test tenant where the account is a full owner and we can not only test out the dev/test workflow but also the prod workflow so there could be concerns with #EXT# and RBAC.
2) We need to use the Azure MCP servers as well as MS documentation
3) We need to use/track all 46 Azure policies for AKV
4) We need to test all workflows for dev/test, production as well as using the concepts of audit, deny, enforce, etc
5) We need to have a plan for what we need to do in dev/test (for a different subscription down the road) and for production (again a different subscription than what we are using now)
6) I don't want any helper or external scripts. Please keep all code inline to the main Setup script and AzPolicy implementation script
7) Please track all work in the todos.md and in the workspace
8) Please don't patch the reports, fix the source code that generates the reports
9) If we need to enable public firewall access to allow a creation of an object/artifact or to test something, this is acceptable until the needed operation is complete - then disable public access.
